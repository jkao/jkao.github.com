Playbook HTML5 Hiragana-Katakana Trainer
---
* Built for Playbook developer program (free Playbook!)
* Uses Backbone.js, underscore.js and Foundation, so it's 
  a good demo for people wanting to learn.
* Try it out with different screen sizes, it'll adjust! However, it's
  forced landscape on the PlayBook since it looks better that way ;)
* Many more possible future features, feel free to fork!

TODO:
---
* Minify and group together assets
* Refactor code (see comments in code)
* Modularize underscore templates, similar to asset pipeline in Rails
  via.. bash? Could be part of the minify scripts, too
* Add cool new features!
