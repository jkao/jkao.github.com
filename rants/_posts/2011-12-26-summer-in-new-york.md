"We've decided that you can work in New York for the summer, give it a
talk with your parents and we can move forward with this"

Or at least it went something like that. It was the beginning of
Summer 2011 and I was always considering consulting as something I'd be
interested in doing in the future. So I went and applied to a few
consulting companies that were posted in my university site and despite
some tempting offers including some California tech companies, I had
decided that I'd give consulting a go, at a company called [Infusion
Development](http://infusion.com). The reason being that I felt that
there'd be a lot of valuable experience in being able to work on
several projects from end-to-end, and iterating with clients, especially
given the fact that co-op terms are so darn short. This was especially
true since I came from Sybase working on a massive product and really
only building out a few dinky features with no real ownership in the
product... not to say that it's a bad thing, but it really wasn't what
I was looking for.

So the perks were pretty much everything I could hope for:

1. Free Housing? Check.
2. Monthly Food Stipend? Check.
3. Free flight, and not just a free flight, but free round-trip flights
   to Toronto every two weeks? Sign me up!

Then I arrived in New York and holy geez, everything is bigger here! So
much to see and do, although work was pretty high up in the list. I'll
make it an easier read and discuss work and life as separate sections.

Work as a Software Consultant was pretty fun. I got a lot of
opportunities to
talk directly with clients, but also did a ton of coding from
ground-up, working largely on web applications.

The company was largely a Microsoft/C#/.NET sort of firm, but
the practices employed and architecture were pretty modern and a lot
more agile than most companies in the enterprise business.
Staffing always seemed to be an issue in the company, as we
attempted to find consultants of the required calibre and skillset for
the project, although coming in as an intern I didn't really have any
of these frameworks under my belt, but I managed to pick it up pretty
quickly regardless, despite all the frustrations I had to deal with
using sparse documentation at times.

But when I think about it, that's one thing I don't
really like about consulting and it's the fact that people seem to use
you specifically for your skillset and sometimes lose sight of the fact
that as a developer you ought to be a generally good problem solver and
capable of picking up the tools on the spot. But this really isn't much
of an option due to the fact that consulting rates are hourly and pretty
darn hefty.

Work was pretty much "work-hard, play-hard" as I would work my butt off until
3 AM at points when the project deadline was around the corner. This was
partially due to the fact that we were short on talent at times and
definitely understaffed. But you could definitely see the "play-hard"
part of the culture through 
the fact that everyone was young and pretty driven, and we'd end up
going drinking or pool or whatever there was to do in New York (which is
a heckuvalot, even at 3 AM), in the middle of work.

What's next? Well, there were some aspects that I've liked from the
work, namely the ownership I got in the projects, but also a lot of things
I didn't like so much with the technology, the nature of the
company, and all the hassle of politics versus being able to actually 
do something. That's why I'm pursuing a startup as my next co-op position 
since this is where I'll probably find what I've been looking for.

Life and Culture in New York

Now comes the actual interesting part, haha. So what I've formulated up
is that:

If there's something you want to do, New York has it.

![Hipsters are all over New York... even in Chinatown](/img/hipster.png)

I really do mean that, but the best part of spending a long time in New
York are all the experiences you end going through... not all the tourist-y
things you get dragged on for bus tours, though that aspect is also a
little fun but short-term which you can probably find on Yelp.
But really, the best parts of NY can only be done by spending a
relatively long time there, and off the top of my head some highlights
include:

* Working until 8 PM, going out to pool and beer, and coming back to
  work until 3 AM... and waking up for 8:30 AM next day for a meeting with
  clients like a boss
* Getting hussled for what should have been free CD's people were
  handing out
* Finishing work and going to a New Jersey mansion via "party bus", and
  of course no shortage of alcohol that night
* Eating burritos everyday for probably two months, would have done it
  longer had I discovered the magic of Mexican food earlier
* Hording chicken nuggets from McDonald's with the 20 for $5 deal in the
  US... it's something you'd NEVER see in Canada
* Realizing that the secret telephone in Criff Dogs leads to a
  surprisingly disappointing bar
* Going to the Magic Johnson Harlem 9 Theater... surprisingly good seats
  and space and cheap, too, despite the ghetto name and location!

Coming from Toronto, I'm pretty used to the multicultural aspects of the
city, but you can think of NY as a more lively, packed downtown Toronto.
There are so many people from different places that you can try out a
lot of different food (though I am not a big fan of asian food in the
Big Apple, haven't really found anything that can compare to most decent
Toronto restaurants). Food there, unless it's fast food, is
considerably more expensive, but the quality of food in general is
pretty high, especially if you're willing to pay for it.

Going on a subway itself was a pretty interesting experience... there're
always trains running even at 3 in the morning, perfect for me being the
night owl that I am. Heck, a lot of places are open at that time which
made me a little disappointed coming back to Toronto to find that
everything was closed when I went out at the same time.

Another aspect that I really did find interesting was how people kept
talking about money and it really does reflect [Paul Graham's essays
about Cities and Ambitions](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html).
Seems that irrelevant status symbols seem to be engrained in to the New
York mindset. One
noteable time, I was in an elevator dressed with a polo t-shirt and
jeans (no clients that day), and a guy asked me if I lived in the
building. I don't know if he was trying to be offensive but I told him I
was going to work and he asked me what I did and I told him that I was
working as a Software Consultant which kind of threw him off based on
his expressions. It's not too uncommon to find this behaviour,
especially coming from Hong Kong, but it's a little surprising.

So would I want to live here? Probably not, I think the lack of space
and culture is not quite there for me, though I'd love to spend
relatively more time in New York either via co-op or
projects, since there are so many things I'd still love to do and would
love to meet more hackers at meetups which I disappointingly attended
very few of. With that, I'm headed off to San Francisco for my upcoming
work term and I'll make sure to write and take pictures to share the
experience.
