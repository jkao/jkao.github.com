If you didn't know, I'm currently enrolled in the **Computer
Engineering**
Program at the **University of Waterloo**. It requires that I do **4-month
internships** (AKA co-ops) usually alternated between schools. For my last
co-op term (Winter 2012), I was fortunate enough to work in **San
Francisco** at a **Y-Combinator** startup called
[PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com). 

For posts on travel (namely co-op), I like to separate the content in to
two parts: [Work](#work) and [Living](#living). So I'll start off with work, as I did with my [New York Post](/rants/2011/12/26/summer-in-new-york.html):

My past internships have been at relatively large companies so it was a
good change to work at a startup. I had some expectations coming in that
are pretty ridiculous now that I think about it. Largely, I was
expecting that things would be blowing up everywhere, the world would be
on fire, and I'd be working crazy hours to fix them and ship out new
things at the same time.

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/stress.jpg" alt="AHHH!" class="three-hundred" />
</div>

...and well, really nobody actually does that. If you're working like
that, you're definitely **doing something wrong**. Working like that doesn't
really scale, and I definitely felt that when I was [working as a
consultant in New York](/rants/2011/12/26/summer-in-new-york.html).

I'll try and summarize with a few bullet points about how working at a
startup felt like in San Francisco:

## Work Content

When you work at a startup, you're **guaranteed** to have an impact due to
the nature of small organizations. While at first it might be
intimidating, it's also something that you learn to love and **will
definitely miss in larger organizations**.

Personally, I love work that **directly impacts customers and clients**. I
chose this job at a startup and a job as a consultant last term for that reason. It's
great to be a **good engineer**, and it's even better when you can apply
those engineering skills to **directly impact the business**. Larger
companies tend to give employees, ESPECIALLY interns, projects that **might
be cool**, but tend to be **"nice-to-have's"**. To me, that's just saying that:

1. They **don't really trust you and your abilities**
2. It **wouldn't really matter** if you did anything or finished that
   project

While working at a startup, worse comes to worse, even if they felt
number 1 in the list above (which doesn't really make sense for a
startup), the 2nd part would definitely be there. Startups don't have
the resources of larger companies to let employees do whatever they
want, and that simply means you'll be getting work that will have a
direct impact to the business.

The result of this is that:

1. You get a lot of **ownership**
2. You **learn more** from more responsibilities
3. You get treated like **another fellow full-time employee**
4. Your **opinions do matter** and help shape up the solutions you design
5. You're also **responsible when \*\*\*\* hits the fan**

These are all aspects that will shape you in to a good engineer. More
importantly, it gives you a lot of insight on to **product development**,
and the **business side of things**. Those are the aspects that make an
engineer well-suited not just for **entrepreneurship**, but also for
developing products that keep clients and customers in mind. That's a
key and fundamental basis for determining success in a product; being
**customer-oriented**.

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/pdhero.jpg" alt="PagerDuty Hero!" class="three-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">PagerDuty to the Rescue!</em>

Having said this, there are definitely aspects that aren't as great.
Obviously, having a lot of ownership means that **when things break,
you'll be the one to take care of them**. Additionally, you'll find that a
lot of work that you end up doing is **work that needs to be done**. This
could potentially mean that the things you have to do may not be as
glorious, but that shouldn't stop you. 

Naturally, there are a TON
of things that need to get done at a small company and you'll find that
there's a **backlog of cool things** you can get around to working on if you 
decide to take initiatitive to do it. In fact, one of the best ways to
do this is through **Hackathons** at your company. One of the
things that I felt would be cool to see for PagerDuty was
internationalizing the site and seeing how it would affect conversions,
so I migrated the Marketing site to **support i18n** and voila I won the
Hack-day trophy. :)

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/hack.jpg" alt="Hackday!" class="three-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">Celebrated my Internationalization hack winning with my name in
Japanese!</em>

So to sum it up, if you don't like to be in a **fast-moving
environment** where the things you do are **directly your responsibility**, 
then a startup might not be the ideal place to work. I'd like to think of it as a
**high-risk, high-reward** sort of job.

## Work Culture

Another large aspect I look for in a company is its **culture**. Although
engineering ability is an incredibly important indicator of success at a
technical position in a startup, **culture is probably just as important**.
You're going to be working with a select few engineers day-to-day with a
ton of stuff to do. You'd better make sure that when things start
breaking, **your team will come out strong**. 

A strong culture is the thing that determines success through stressful 
situations, and having ever-present technical risks
day-to-day definitely makes hiring for culture almost, if not as equally
important, as hiring for technical ability in engineering. A good team
is one that **collaborates, communicates, and is transparent from
top-down**.

</div>
<em class="center">Hanging out on the PagerDuty Roof!</em>

For my case, PagerDuty was awesome, because we were such a small team
that we'd hang out after work. It's not just that your co-workers are
your co-workers, but they're your friends. This is something you'd
definitely want to encourage in any organization. It's kind of like a
team sport; just as you wouldn't want to let down your team, you'd feel
the same way with your startup buddies. Ultimately, that leads to **happier, more
productive output** from your team.

# Living in San Francisco

I'm assuming most of you guys have skipped to this section, as the
question in everybody's mind is: **What's it like to live in San
Francisco?**

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/baybridge2.jpg" alt="Golden Gate's little brother,
the Bay Bridge!" class="five-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">Golden Gate's little Brother, the Bay Bridge!</em>

## Culture

As one of the "big cities",
San Francisco still has some night life and a few nice restaurants, but
definitely **pales in comparison to New York in terms of number of city-ish things to do** (i.e. - bars/restaurants/etc). However, it's definitely **unique** 
for having **the Bay** and has a lot of awesome things in that aspect. 

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/bow.jpg" alt="Golden Gate's little brother,
the Bay Bridge!" class="four-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">Quirky</em>

Being on the west coast, it also means there's a **significant Asian
presence** there. San Francisco has both a **Chinatown and Japantown**.
Chinatown is a pretty standard Chinatown, with its fair share of sketchy
old asian men gambling and relatively cheap food. You can get pound of
Dim Sum and still pay less than $10 for take out. :)

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/dimsum.JPG" alt="Sketchy Dim Sum is the best" class="three-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">It might look sketchy, but that's how you know the Dim Sum is good! (..and cheap ;) )</em>

However, after being in
New York and San Francisco, I still feel that **Asian cuisine in
Toronto still trumps both**, all at a cheaper cost, too. Thai food in San
Francisco is pretty excellent and would be the exception. Japantown is
quite a bit more unique since there really aren't a lot of them in North
America, and you can definitely see it when you're there. All in all,
it's really just one large mall in San Francisco, but nonetheless there
are quite a lot of unique things in there. The restaurants are largely
run by Koreans, so technically it's not so much Japantown, but
regardless, it's a nice illusion :P

<div class="center">

People in San Francisco are generally **really laid back and liberal**.
People aren't quite as materialistic as in New York, but they're also a 
little quirky
sometimes. They're really accepting and you can find great conversations with
people randomly, and you'll find that **people are generally helpful and
nice**. Of course there are always exceptions, but this is what I've felt
in general.

<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/sf/burger.jpg" alt="Super Duper" class="three-hundred" />
</div>
<em class="center">Unfortunately, New York Burgers still trump Bay area ones. Shake
Shack FTW!</em>

Also, as much as I'd like to think that everything in
Hacker News is true, if you tell most people you're working at a startup, 
they probably won't be impressed and won't have any idea what you're
talking about. San Francisco is a **hotbed for tech startups**, but it also
has more normal people than what seems to be hyped about online. 
(this is supposed to be a good thing :P) I took a Japanese class while I
was there and expected everybody to be an engineer, but it was a refreshing
change that nobody was. That's an incredibly important aspect to have in
an area full of engineers - a non-tech perspective, since you'll find
more problems outside of engineering that can be solved with tech (and
likely more relevant to 'normal' people).

In general, the age median of San Francisco is actually quite old. There
aren't a whole lot of families and kids running around and it totally
makes sense considering the rent costs there. That also meant that while
I was working there, there weren't a lot of people quite at my age.
Luckily, a bunch of people from Waterloo were doing their co-ops there
so I just ended up hanging out with them :)

Like any big city, San Francisco has its ghetto parts. Not nearly as bad
as New York, but the Tenderloin is pretty unique in some sense. I feel
like any big city has its own characteristics for ghettos. Of course,
San Francisco rent is unreasonably high, so naturally there will be a
pretty large ghetto. Some unique aspects that I found wandering the
Tenderloin include:

1. Realizing that the dog crap left on the ground.. **usually didn't
   belong to dogs**
2. People stand around at 3 AM standing at street-corners and **literally
   do NOTHING** except stare. They don't talk or anything or act ghetto
   like in the movies or Harlem, they just stand there on street
   corners. Kind of strange. Hm.
3. One exception to number 2 is that everybody in the neighbourhood runs
   out to the streets and gets rowdy when there's a fight going on. 
   If there's a fight,
   it literally changes from two people on the corner of the street to
   the whole neighbourhood in the next 5 seconds.
I saw this when I saw a crazed crack-lady
   fight some homeless dude. Of course, the crack-lady won, but I didn't
   stay too long fearing for my safety.
4. Pho tastes the best when you **fear for your life**. (i.e. - the Pho in
   the Tenderloin is REALLY good)

My timing was good enough that I managed to get a position in San Francisco 
for the Winter. Of course, all my friends and family from Toronto were
jealous saying things like "Oh, you're not going to have to deal with
snow etc etc etc". Getting down there, I realized it wasn't as warm as
I had thought and, really, it's quite misleading what some people tell
you. If you want warm - head further south to San Diego :)
The bay area is quite nice in the sense that it's not TOO hot and not
TOO cold. Summers are like spring and winters are like falls, if you know
what I mean. I
actually like that sort of weather since it means the only thing you
really need to worry about is wearing a jacket or not and planning for
rain.

Now the question is - would I go there again? Would I live there for
full-time? San Francisco is great because it's not as hectic and
fast-paced as New York which can get nerve-wracking sometimes. It's a
really 'nice' city in the sense that you'll find there's both a night
life and there's also a touch of nature not too far. Really, the
only thing that kills it for me is the ghastly rent costs (though New
York is arguably more expensive... but Infusion paid it all for me
anyways, hehe).

Bar that, it's an awesome place to get your career started and also to
network with people. All the tech companies you see online are basically
here and are probably a block away if you're working in the SOMA area.
Plus, geeks love to party and there's always something going on in the
area (i.e. - plenty of booze to go around). :) You also get the latest
tech perks since everyone's starting up here (i.e. - Google Wallet,
Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Square etc etc). Non-techwise, San Francisco 
has a really healthy culture and I could definitely see myself living there
long-term over New York.

So that's it - I really love the Bay area, so I'm going back there
for another co-op term. This time at a cool company called
[Inkling](http://inkling.com) where I'll be working on Platform and Backend
Infrastructure... and yes, I'll make sure to blog about that, too!
