Took a quick look at [this article](http://swanson.github.com/blog/2011/12/04/whats-on-your-learning-list.html)
yesterday and it inspired me to brainstorm a few things off my head that
I wanted to learn, so here goes nothing:

1. Scala - Play Framework?
2. Functional Programming
3. Improve Photoshop Skillz
4. Intro to Machine Learning
5. Intro to Distributed Systems
6. Learn more about entrepreneurship and how to ship code for a startup
7. NoSQL - MongoDB and Redis?
8. Maybe improve my C/C++ skills? Might be useful for distributed
9. Learn more about large-scale web application architecture, SOA?
10. Android/iOS Development
11. Backbone.js

I think that's a pretty good list and I can definitely tackle a few in
the coming weeks.

Of course, the list is only relevant for development, but outside of
technical skills, there are a lot of things I could hope to improve and
that'll probably be a page in my Evernote.

What's your learning list for 2012? Does it look similar to mine?
