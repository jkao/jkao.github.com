</div>

After working 4 months at Y-Combinator startup, [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com),
I feel I've matured more as a developer. One aspect that I feel that has been vital
to my daily work has been how various factors affect my productivity.
I use a lot of tools and techniques to try and keep my focus on tasks, and to
measure productivity and felt that others might benefit if I share them.

As a rule of thumb, I'd like to think that **productivity is proportional to the amount
of sustained, contiguous focus** one can achieve. Naturally, context switching is the
thing that will be detrimental to productivity. The tools and techniques I use
help me optimize for this, but I still have a lot to learn.

So here goes nothing:

## Music

</div>
Music is really dependent on the person, and various studies have shown mixed
results in terms of focus and music. Heck, you could even ask your friends and
you're probably guaranteed that it's different between people. For me, music
is the signal for my brain to realize that it's time to start working and get focused.
Furthermore, it helps reduce the mentioned 'context switching' by removing
environmental noise. I feel like there needs to be some sort of
background activity going on otherwise it almost gives me the sense that
I'm not being monitored and won't be pushed... a little strange but
perhaps [this article will help](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/working-best-at-coffee-shops/237372/).

In terms of specific music, I tend to listen to a combination of Jazz Beats,
Metal, and 80's, depending on my mood or time of day and depending on
the task. If I need to think about the problem and it's challenging Jazz
Beats tend to help me stay focused, and I pull out Metal when I need to
chug out lots of code.

## Break Down Tasks into Smaller, Manageable Tasks
<div class="center">

</div>
When I see a huge project or task presented to me, my brain almost
immediately goes in to a panic. It's natural - you even feel this in
coding interviews and that's why people ask you hard coding questions. Can
you remain calm and figure out where to start or do you give up?

The trick to dealing with huge tasks (or even small tasks) is to break them
down in to smaller manageable and consumable tasks. If you don't enforce
these things you can easily get lost and feel like you're getting
nowhere. You definitely feel more **motivated** and **satisfied** when
even a huge task is breaking down. Heck, even reviewing the things
you've managed to achieve gives you a little boost.

So what tool do I use for this? I use [Asana](http://asana.com), largely
for work, but also recently for personal tasks. I used to use
[AndBang](http://andbang.com) for my tasks but I feel like Asana has a
larger feature set and development for it will be more reliable.
Once you get used to the still relatively-small learning curve, it's a 
good tool. Do.com also comes to mind, but I haven't used it.

## Find Other Hobbies - Take Breaks!
<div class="center">

</div>
In my case, I like various sport activites (Martial Arts, Soccer), and
play instruments aside from coding and learn new languages (current
Japanese). It's incredibly important to have other hobbies because when
you hit a roadblock in one thing you do - say you run in to a bug that
has gotten you stuck for days - it can be **EXTREMELY** frustrating. If
you have other hobbies, at least you can feel that you have measurable
success in **SOMETHING**, and that feeling is incredibly important to
have to keep you motivated and prevent you from burning out.

In terms of daily examples, there are times that I feel like there's a
lot to do at work and I just can't keep going. So what do I do? I go to
the gym for a workout or go for a run, take a shower, and come back. My
mind is clear and I can go back to work. If you're thinking about
something **ALL** the time, then when you run in to problems you can
easily get depressed. So find something to do that you enjoy - my tip,
however, is to try and do something that will take you **AWAY** from the
computer (that is - if you are someone who spends most of their time doing
computer work).

## Get Proper Sleep
<div class="center">
  <img src="/img/productivity/sleep.jpeg" alt="Asana... the super useful Project Management Tool!" />
</div>
I feel like this is an often stressed point, but even so, I felt that
this was important to include in the post. Sleep is king. Most people
are good with approximately 8 hours of sleep give or take a few hours.
Personally, I feel that I'm more productive if I sleep earlier and wake
up earlier. However, sometimes various constraints prevent this. The
solution? Well, if you force yourself to wake up early even if you have
slept late your body will definitely adjust, but you may not have the
proper amount of sleep to be as productive as you could be. So my
suggestion is try and take naps if possible and try to re-adjust.

However, I feel that **the wrong solution is to rely on
performance-enhancing chemicals such as caffeine**. I can definitely see
people arguing against this - especially those of us who have it daily.
But I want a scalable solution. People who drink caffeine regularly
require more and more caffeine and depend on it. It's hard to stop and
really I feel that it should be used in moderation and as a last ditch
result for those days when you don't really have a choice.

## Eat Properly
<div class="center">

</div>
The most important meal stressed by everyone is breakfast. So what
should you do? Eat a proper breakfast! Also, don't constantly stuff
yourself on days you need to get done. Itis can be a horrible thing to
productivity ;). There are a lot of articles about this, so I'd suggest
reading them to get an idea of why and what to eat.

## Invest Time to Learn Tools that will Help
If learning a tool will help you improve your
productivity, it's important to take some time each week to learn a
little bit more. Why? If it can improve your daily productivity it
really does add up. If it reduces things like your feedback loop, DO IT.
It's important. It's like test-driven development - it WILL save you
time in the long run.

An example I like to use is my text editor of choice - VIM. I use it
every single day and have used it since my 2nd co-op job; I haven't
looked back. There was a point where my learning curve really hit
its high and I kept learning and that's because I forced myself to use
it. As a programmer, if you can even edit your text a LITTLE bit faster
each day, those things WILL add up. Think about it - everytime you're
not actually thinking of what you're building, you're wasting
time just TYPING it out. VIM helps you reduce that feedback loop and
this results in a little less context-switching, which is that thing
that kills your productivity.

## Conclusion 
So a lot of things I've talked about are really related to me being a
Software Engineer, but this can apply to school, personal life and
really anything that requires you to do something. Also, my main
assumption here is that **you are doing something you WANT to do**.
There might be times where you really don't want to do something, but it
has to be done (like school assignments.. heh). At a fundamental level,
you should not be doing things you don't really want to do, but even
with that, there will be things that **NEED** to be done. I find that
the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) really helps for those instances.
