description: Some thoughts on Hacker News and what it's taught me.
---

It's been over three years since I found out what Hacker News was, and I
feel that I owe a blog post (if not more) to detail my adventures,
ambitions, and madness that I can only attribute to reading Hacker News.
I also feel it's pretty appropriate at this time when everyone seems to
be complaining about the quality of submissions and whatnot.

Hacker News for me has served a lot of purposes for me over the years,
and I feel it's important for others who don't read it to start reading
it. Hacker News has helped develop me as a 'Hacker' in a number of ways,
of which I'll try and list a few:

Learning
---

Technology wise,
when I first started reading Hacker News, everything was completely new.
I didn't know what Rails, Scala, Machine Learning, 'Big Data', Cassandra
or any keywords were (to be fair, I'm still in the process of learning
these things). I'm no expert at a lot of things on
Hacker News, but at least I have a pretty good idea of what people are
talking about. Given this, it puts in to perspective what you still have
to learn as an engineer and the business implications for doing so. 

Your
primary source of value as an engineer is the ability to solve problems,
and knowing the tools available out there gives you a broader tool kit
to produce an efficient and maintainable solution. There are a lot of
hard engineering problems. There are also a lot of SOLVED hard
engineering problems. Therefore, it's quite obvious that you should be
solving the UNSOLVED problems, yet somehow a lot of companies tend to
solve similar problems over and over again. Hacker News always has
projects popping up that usually help solve problems (whether it be in
the business sense as a startup/project/SaaS or in the engineering sense
as a library or package). It's
important to keep up to date with these things if you want to be a good
engineer.

Opportunity Cost
---

Another popular set of posts that I find apart from tech and
code-focused subjects tend to be those of tech employees ranting about
their experiences. A lot of experience and knowledge from people a few
years down the road from you can be helpful. There tends to be quite a
lot of noise, but there are also a lot of gems.

Why do people stop working at Facebook and Google? Why do people
love/hate
consulting? Why do people get burnt out at startups? What are some good
lifestyle changes I should make if I want to follow any of these paths?

There are a lot of answers (not necessarily right answers) through
articles in HN which address them. Of course, the best way to figure it
out is to talk to people directly and go try things yourself, but a lot
of frustrations and problems with going down each path can be avoided by
just knowing things beforehand.

As a university student, I'm constantly pondering about these questions
(especially since taking part in internships is part of my program). So
figuring out a way to jump-start my career and making the right (and
wrong) choices early on can save a lot of time and frustration.

The subset of people who read HN is very small in the grand scale of
things. Probably over 95% of the places software developers will work
will be void of HN readers, and knowing more and learning more can help
you accelerate over your peers given this vast source of knowledge.

Learn to Build Your Own Opinion
---

Yet another category of posts tends to be things about startups getting
acquired, people launching their projects, and in general news about the
latest tech gadgets/cloud services/etc. As the internet generally goes,
there's a lot of hate and butt-kissing. Even with the HN group, you'll
find that people may have strong opinions that you don't agree with or
totally agree with. Some people have opinions without justification,
others do, but in the end it's really important to take a lot of things
as a grain of salt and reason about things yourself. Remember, HN
readers are a tiny subset of the internet. There are people who do
greater things, make more money, have more experiences (if those are
your life goals, for example), so don't limit your world view to what's
on HN, but take it as yet another source of opinions that will
perhaps influence your life decisions.

You will definitely understand more if your company posts a product
launch on HN and you read the comments. There's a lot of misinformation
that people have who don't know what they're talking about (even if they
are really smart), simply because they don't actually work at the
company and know what will happen. It's natural. People speculate. They
can speculate closely, or wildly inaccurately. That's why I don't read
TechCrunch religiously - it's because you only get a very skewed sense
of the truth, if any. It's like Poker. When you see WPT videos, you only
get about an hour of exciting hands and crazy all-in rounds. You don't
see the literally hours upon hours of sitting and waiting for a hand
(patience is a virtue in poker) that the professionals take. Media
companies have to make money after all. So given that, don't limit
yourself to the mindset from the internet, but form an opinion on top of
it.

There's a pretty good compiled list of good Hacker News articles here,
and of course there are more, but it'll take a little more digging:
